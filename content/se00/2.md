This podcast story was generated by playing [Fiasco](http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/games/fiasco/) using the playset [Clock Blockers](http://fiascoplaysets.com/home/clock-blockers).

This episode was a long time coming, but unfortunately it looks way too long to get it from game session to a script that was workable, and it's not complete. Because it was going to be so long, I had to chop this episode into two parts. Hopefully you enjoy!
