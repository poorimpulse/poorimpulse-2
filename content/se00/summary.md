Season 0 was the original idea behind this podcast.  Play games of fiasco, write
stories based on those games, and then record audiobooks of the story.

Yeah, that didn't work so well.  The amount of time required to go all those steps
meant it was impossible to get an episode out in a month.  From arranging play sessions
to getting to the script was daunting, so that idea was abandoned.

A few stories managed to come together and make it into episodes.  These are those stories.
