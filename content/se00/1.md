A grandson and his grandfather hatch schemes to make money in the great white north.

This podcast story was generated by playing [Fiasco](http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/games/fiasco/) using the playset [Last Frontier](http://www.fiascoplaysets.com/home/last-frontier).

Thank you for trying out my new podcast. This is an experiment to help me learn audio recording/editing, audiobook narration, and force me to work on short stories. It's also a great excuse to play Fiasco with my friends and family. This first episode was all about learning, and boy did I learn alot. That's why the episode isn't perfect, but I appreciate you taking the time to listen, and know that future episodes will be vastly improved over this first one. Let's consider this a beta, shall we?

**Narrator:** Russell Hay
