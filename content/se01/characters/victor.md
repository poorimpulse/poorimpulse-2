Growing up poor, Victor endears himself to those of means whom he also resents. This eternal chip on his shoulder is often dipped in the habanero salsa of self-created situations of extreme peril.

He’s smart but reckless and unreliable; this also makes him a skeleton key which unlocks the doors of opportunity and escape which seem all but quarks a moment before.

Through numerous errors in accounting and admittance, he became a student at a prestigious university. At university, he tested well but nearly flunked out on account of his contempt for all authority, routinely professors. Though his wit, charm and intellect carried him through. These days he’s sharpened all three, and they are routinely the tools on which he depends as he climbs the social strata, using his foppery to traffic in information…as it suits him.
