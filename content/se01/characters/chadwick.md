Biography will go here

Two little mice fell in a bucket of cream. The first mouse quickly gave up and drowned. The second mouse, wouldn't quit. He struggled so hard that eventually he churned that cream into butter and crawled out. Gentlemen, as of this moment, I am that second mouse. You got the wrong guy, ace! Did you hear about the happy Roman? He was "glad he ate her." He hid it in the one place he knew he could hide something: his ass. Five long years, he wore this watch up his ass. Then, when he died of dysentery, he gave me the watch. I'm neglecting my other guests. Enjoy yourself, you'll find the young ladies stimulating company. I thought about you every time I jerked off, dickhead. You're talking to me all wrong... It's the wrong tone. You do it again and I'll stab you in the face with a soldering iron. Hey, tell me, does your mother sew? BOOM. Get her to sew that! Selina! Selina Kyle, you're fired! And Bruce Wayne, why are you dressed up like Batman? I don't know what you want, but I know I can get it for you, with a minimum of fuss! Money, jewels, a *very* big ball of string. This is America, babe, you gotta think big to be big. I got a fever, and the only prescription is more cowbell. You know why the Yankees always win, Frank? it's 'cause the other teams can't stop staring at those damn pinstripes.
