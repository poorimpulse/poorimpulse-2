You measure yourself by the people who measure themselves by you. I did the same thing to Gandhi, he didn't eat for three weeks. I now issue a new commandment: Thou shalt do the dance. Mister Wayne, if you don't want to tell me exactly what you're doing, when I'm asked, I don't have to lie. But don't think of me as an idiot. That tall drink of water with the silver spoon up his ass. Bruce... I'm God. The man likes to play chess; let's get him some rocks. I once heard a wise man say there are no perfect men. Only perfect intentions. Let me tell you something my friend. Hope is a dangerous thing. Hope can drive a man insane. I don't think they tried to market it to the billionaire, spelunking, BASE-jumping crowd. Circumstances have taught me that a man's ethics are the only possessions he will take beyond the grave. It only took me six days. Same time it took the Lord to make the world.
