Riley is the youngest recruit LOGIC ever accepted into any branch of the
agency. He was recruited after hacking into their internal communication
systems.

Riley specializes in bombs, improved devices, and technology, leading him to
be a blow-shit-up-first wildcard.  Chicago didn't want him, New York tired of him quickly, and DC wouldn't touch him Dick Chaney's dentures, so he was
shipped off to LOGIC London due to their staff shortage.
