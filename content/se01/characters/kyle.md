Kyle Quinn was always good at reading people, following patterns, and reading the signs. When presented with a situation Kyle's gift was able to see all of the angles and put it all together to determine the best approach. It's not only how he charmed his wife the first time they met, but how he made agent at LOGIC. Through some friends of the family (Kyle always seemed to know a guy who knows a guy) he caught the agency's attention. There's just one tiny issue - he can't seem to turn it off. He could easily set himself up for an early retirement, but wherever there's a problem, he thinks he can see exactly where it can be fixed.
