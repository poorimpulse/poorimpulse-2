[Poor Impulse Control](http://poorimpulse.co) is a listener-supported
show.  Listeners like you.  I want to make it as easy as possible for
you to enjoy the content.

Luckily, there is very little on-going cost for the show, but there was
an initial investment, and that's what we are trying to recoop through
listener donations.
