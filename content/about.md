[Poor Impulse Control](http://poorimpulse.co) is an audiobook podcast.
It's an excuse to play games with family and friends, write stories based
on those games, and to learn audio editing and narration.

It's a learning process, and I appreciate you joining me on this journey.
some episodes will be rough, especially as the beginning as I learn all
the tricks of recording and editing audio, so bear with me.

Thanks, and enjoy the ride!
