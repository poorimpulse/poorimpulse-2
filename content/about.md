[Poor Impulse](http://poorimpulse.co) is a real-play podcast feature Fate Accelerated and the Dresden Files Accelerated system.

Set in New Orleans in a dark timeline where the fae and loas intermingle and the mortals face the fall out, Poor Impulse spins horror and urban fantasy into an ecletic, irreverant yarn with just a dash of gay, and patriarchy smashing fun.
